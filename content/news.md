<h3 class="f3">New paper on structural underpinnings of the µ-opioid receptor</h3>
<i>April 10, 2024</i>
<br><br>
Our collaborative project on the structural underpinnings of super-efficacy at the µ-opioid receptor was recently published in <i>Nature</i> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07295-2">read online</a>). Many thanks to the Kobilka (Stanford) and Chen (Tsinghua) labs for a great collaboration. Check out the University of Leipzig's press release <a href="https://research.uni-leipzig.de/sfb1423/insight-into-the-molecular-causes-of-different-functions-of-the-opioid-receptor/">here</a>!
