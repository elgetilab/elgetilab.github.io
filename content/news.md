Our Master's student, Anna Krauspe, successfully defended her thesis. The thesis was titled "<i>The effect of solid-support attachment on the ligand binding affinity of the maltose binding protein (MBP)</i>". 

Anna has already done a great job on the project, and even more exciting results are coming. 
We wish her all the best for her future work!

<h3 class="f3">SFB1423 Winter Retreat</h3>
<i>December 5, 2024</i>
<br><br> 

Our group attended the SFB1423 Winter Retreat in Grimma. Doctoral students Dilara, Martin and Julia presented posters. 

Dilara talked about establishing protocols for the expression of Y2 receptors in E. coli and HEK cells, and shared future plans. Martin reported on the technique for selecting spin labeling sites in protein molecules. He also presented a newly developed method to study the ligand-dependent conformational equilibria using DEER. Julia presented an updated version of the integrative approach to construct all-atom structural models of rare GPCR conformations from sparse DEER data. And Matthias gave talks on allosteric modulation of GPCRs and the role of conformational equilibria in signalling. 

The retreat was full of discussions, sharing practical insights between members of the GPCR community. Thank you all for your work and participation!

<h3 class="f3">Martin Buhlmann joins the Elgeti lab for his PhD</h3>
<i>September 26, 2024</i>
<br><br>
This week, Martin Buhlmann presented and successfully defended his master’s thesis titled: “<i>Exploring the Conformational Landscape of Maltose Binding Protein Using EPR Spectroscopy</i>” in which he applied a novel theoretical framework to study the ligand binding to the model protein MBP.

We are excited to keep Martin as a PhD student. He will be part of the collaborative research center "Structural Dynamics of GPCR Activation and Signaling" (SFB 1423).

In preparation for Julia's PhD work, we wrote a review about structural modeling using EPR constraints. It was very interesting and important to summarize what's out there and which tools are missing. Today it's finally out in <i>eLife</i>. (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99770">read online</a>). Great job, Julia!
