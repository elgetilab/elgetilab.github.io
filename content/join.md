# Join

Join the Elgeti Lab as we build our team!

## Open positions

**Graduate student**. Are you interested in protein design, hyperpolarization, and the development of new molecular sensors? Join [Hyp*Mol](https://www.hypmol.net/), a new, collaborative, and interdisciplinary research program funded by the German Research Foundation. The open position is for a graduate (PhD) student, who will be mentored jointly by three PIs from Leipzig University (Matthias Elgeti, [Irene Coin](https://www.lw.uni-leipzig.de/en/institute-of-biochemisty/research-groups/coinlab), and [Jens Meiler](https://meilerlab.org/). The successful candidate will apply cutting edge biochemical, spectroscopic and computational methods to design, optimize and integrate novel “Maquette” proteins. Please contact Matthias [here](https://elgetilab.github.io/contact/) for further information and to apply.

## Additional opportunties

We have additional opportunities available that are not listed above. If you are interested in joining the Elgeti Lab as a postdoctoral fellow, graduate student, or student assistant, please contact Matthias [here](https://elgetilab.github.io/contact/).
