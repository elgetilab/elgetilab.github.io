Martin completed his M.Sc. in Chemistry at the University of Leipzig in September 2024, where he conducted his masterâ€™s thesis research in the Elgeti Lab. He has since joined the lab as a PhD student.

Alongside his studies, Martin gained hands-on experience in organic synthesis as a student assistant at HPC Standards GmbH. In addition, he successfully completed the "<i>Advanced Course of Study in Analytics and Spectroscopy</i>" at the University of Leipzig in September 2024.

Martin develops methods to investigate the conformational landscape of model proteins using EPR spectroscopy and computational modeling with the goal to apply these tools to GPCR research in the future.
