Ivan Yushin joined Elgeti lab in January 2025 as Ph.D. student after finishing his Specialist degree in Chemistry at Novosibirsk State University. 
Now he is focusing on an innovative project that integrates cutting-edge technologies into the drug development process.

Ivan's research involves the development of a novel EPR flow-system for ligand screening using 3D printing technology. This universal platform can be used to screen and analyze ligand binding to GPCRs with high precision and efficiency. His project exemplifies the growing trend of interdisciplinary research, where technology plays a crucial role in enabling new discoveries and applications.
