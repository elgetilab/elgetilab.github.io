Markus is a physicist by training who earned his master’s degree at TU Chemnitz, where he worked on Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes. He later obtained his PhD at the Institute of Medical Physics under the supervision of Dr. Holger Scheidt, focusing on membrane interactions of small molecules and GNN-based interaction predictions. 

After completing his PhD, he worked in IT consulting before returning to academia by joining the Elgeti Lab in December 2024. His research interests include graph-based and geometric learning methods, as well as machine learning applications in biophysics. He is currently working on machine-learning-based allosteric drug design.
