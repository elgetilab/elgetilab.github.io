During her Masterâ€™s studies in the Elgeti Lab, Anna developed a novel ligand-binding assay using CW EPR. We are excited that she will continue with us as our lab manager. With her strong background in biochemistry, her positive mindset, and her eagerness to master new techniques, Anna will be an invaluable support to all ongoing and future projects.
