Patricia joined the Elgeti Lab as a PhD student in autumn 2025, after completing her M.Sc. in Biochemistry at the University of Leipzig.

She studies conformational states of arrestins, focusing mainly on arrestin-2, using EPR techniques. During her masterâ€™s studies, she gained experience in all the key experimental methods needed for EPR data analysis. 

In the future, she also plans to expand her work to computational approaches to build high-quality all-atom models of arrestins with all molecular segments resolved.
