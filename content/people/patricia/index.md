Patricia joined the Elgeti Lab as a PhD student in fall 2025, following her M.Sc. in Biochemistry at the University of Leipzig.

Her doctoral research will integrate EPR spectroscopy with computational approaches to investigate the conformational dynamics of arrestins and how these shape their diverse downstream signaling pathways.
