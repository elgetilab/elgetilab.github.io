Julia is currently finishing her master's degree in Bioengineering and Bioinformatics at Lomonosov Moscow State University under the supervision of Dr. Andrey Golovin. She has also worked as a bioinformatician at BostonGene and Lactocore Inc on projects related to the development of cancer therapies and peptidic drugs targeted towards GPCRs, respectively. Julia will join the Elgeti Lab as a PhD student in the summer of 2023.

Julia's research interests include the biology of GPCRs with a particular focus on their medical applications, the exploration of biomacromoleculesâ€™ conformational dynamics, and the development of antibacterial peptides that can help address the growing issue of antibiotic resistance.

Additionally, she is a real cat & coffee lover.
