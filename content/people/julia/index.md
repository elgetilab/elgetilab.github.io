Julia joined the Elgeti Lab as a PhD student in the summer of 2023. She completed her master's degree in Bioengineering and Bioinformatics at Lomonosov Moscow State University. She has also worked as a bioinformatician at BostonGene and Lactocore Inc on projects related to the development of cancer therapies and peptidic drugs targeted towards GPCRs, respectively.

Now she is working on developing an integrative computational approach to model rare conformations of GPCRs from sparse experimental DEER data. She focuses on studying the conformational dynamics of GPCRs and the phenomenon of biased signaling.
