description: Research in the Elgeti Lab focuses on the characterization of protein structure and dynamics using EPR spectroscopy. We develop spectroscopic and computational methods to advance the field and facilitate the development of more effective therapeutics with fewer side effects. In Spring 2023, the Elgeti Lab joined the Institute for Drug Discovery at the University of Leipzig Medical School and the University of Leipzigâ€™s Institute for Medical Physics and Biophysics.
