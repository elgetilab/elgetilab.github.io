<h3 class="f3">New paper on Intra-arrestin bias published</h3>
<i>January 19, 2026</i>
<br><br> 
<center>
<img src="../img/JBC-2026.png" width="600"></img>
</center>
<p>GPCRs are remarkable nano-processors: they bind and activate diverse transducer
proteins—such as G proteins or arrestins—thereby triggering very different cellular responses.
Certain ligands can bias this signaling by selectively stabilizing distinct receptor
conformations and favoring one pathway over another.</p>
<p>Because arrestins themselves are multifunctional, we asked whether an additional
layer of regulation might exist, an “intra-arrestin bias.” Indeed, we found that
two arrestin-biased ligands of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) stabilize
strikingly different arrestin conformations. This results in distinct AT1R–arrestin
complexes and divergent functional outcomes. Great news for future drug discovery!</p>
<p>Julia and Mahdi did an outstanding job running and analyzing molecular dynamics
simulations! This project was part of a great, longstanding collaboration with Laura Wingler&rsquo;s
lab at Duke University. Read the full story

<p>Markus needs serious GPU power to train his graph neural networks — so he applied for funding from the Hyp*MOL consortium to build our own mini-cluster.
His proposal was very well received and has been fully funded!</p>
<p>At this year’s Hyp*MOL status meeting, Markus presented the background and current progress of his project to the community.
Great job, Markus — way to go!</p>

<h3 class="f3">EPR Workshop in Krakow</h3>
<i>October 13-17, 2025</i>
<br><br> 
<p>Our PhD students Dilara and Patricia recently traveled to Krakow (PL) to take part in the 
<a href="https://internationaleprworkshop.pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International EPR Workshop</a>.</p>
<p>The event offered a great mix of scientific exchange and networking opportunities. Dilara and Patricia met new colleagues, shared ideas, and presented their research to an engaged audience. They also took some time to explore the beautiful city of Krakow and sample its famous dumplings.</p>
<p>A special highlight: <strong>Dilara received the prize for the best poster!</strong> Congratulations, Dilara — a fantastic achievement!</p>

<img src="../img/EPRSS_Manchester2025.png" width="1200"></img>
</center>
This summer, three of our students represented the Elgeti Lab at the EPR Summer School in Manchester.
Anna and Martin presented their poster “Investigating conformational equilibria and ligand binding using EPR spectroscopy”, while Sebastian showcased his latest results on “Characterization of flavoprotein mr5411 with transient CW-EPR”.
<p>Beyond the scientific program, the Summer School offered a fantastic chance to connect with fellow graduate students, exchange ideas with leading EPR experts from academia and industry, and develop new skills in lectures and masterclasses. And, of course, our team also found time to explore Manchester — enjoying the city’s atmosphere and creating new friendships along the way.</p>

<p>Our group attended the SFB1423 Winter Retreat in Grimma. Doctoral students Dilara, Martin and Julia presented posters.</p>
<p>Dilara talked about establishing protocols for the expression of Y2 receptors in E. coli and HEK cells, and shared future plans. Martin reported on the technique for selecting spin labeling sites in protein molecules. He also presented a newly developed method to study the ligand-dependent conformational equilibria using DEER. Julia presented an updated version of the integrative approach to construct all-atom structural models of rare GPCR conformations from sparse DEER data. And Matthias gave talks on allosteric modulation of GPCRs and the role of conformational equilibria in signalling.</p>
<p>The retreat was full of discussions, sharing practical insights between members of the GPCR community. Thank you all for your work and participation!</p>
