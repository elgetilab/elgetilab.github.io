      <description>Matthias received his PhD in Biophysics from the Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin, where he worked under the guidance of Drs. Klaus Peter Hofmann and Franz Bartl on time-resolved investigation of photoreactions of visual rhodopsin. He then received postdoctoral training in the laboratory of Dr. Wayne Hubbell at UCLA, where he studied other G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the beta-adrenergic and angiotensin receptors, using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>Julia joined the Elgeti Lab as a PhD student in the summer of 2023. She completed her master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Bioengineering and Bioinformatics at Lomonosov Moscow State University. She has also worked as a bioinformatician at BostonGene and Lactocore Inc on projects related to the development of cancer therapies and peptidic drugs targeted towards GPCRs, respectively.
Now she is working on developing an integrative computational approach to model rare conformations of GPCRs from sparse experimental DEER data.</description>

      <description>Markus is a physicist by training who earned his master’s degree at TU Chemnitz, where he worked on Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes. He later obtained his PhD at the Institute of Medical Physics under the supervision of Dr. Holger Scheidt, focusing on membrane interactions of small molecules and GNN-based interaction predictions.
After completing his PhD, he worked in IT consulting before returning to academia by joining the Elgeti Lab in December 2024.</description>

      <description>Dilara joined the Elgeti Lab in the Winter semester of 2023. She completed her bachelor&amp;rsquo;s and master&amp;rsquo;s degrees in Biology at the Middle East Technical University in Turkey. She worked on adhesion GPCRs during her master&amp;rsquo;s study and subsequently gained experience in structural biology during her internship at the Rudolf Schönheimer Institute for Biochemistry at the University of Leipzig under the supervision of Dr. Sandra Berndt.
Dilara&amp;rsquo;s research is focused on understanding the dynamics of subtype selectivity on peptide receptors of GPCRs.</description>
