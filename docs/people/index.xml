      <description>Julia is currently finishing her master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Bioengineering and Bioinformatics at Lomonosov Moscow State University under the supervision of Dr. Andrey Golovin. She has also worked as a bioinformatician at BostonGene and Lactocore Inc on projects related to the development of cancer therapies and peptidic drugs targeted towards GPCRs, respectively. Julia will join the Elgeti Lab as a PhD student in the summer of 2023.
Julia&amp;rsquo;s research interests include the biology of GPCRs with a particular focus on their medical applications, the exploration of biomacromolecules’ conformational dynamics, and the development of antibacterial peptides that can help address the growing issue of antibiotic resistance.</description>

      <description>Mahdi is a computational biophysicist interested in understanding macromolecular interactions, structures, and dynamics, and how they relate to the function and behavior of biological systems. By utilizing computational methods in an integrative approach with experimental techniques such as NMR (mainly ssNMR) and DEER, he aims to gain a deeper understanding of the physical and chemical principles that govern the behavior of biological macromolecules. Specifically, he is interested in three different macromolecular systems: the sliding and search-to-recognition mechanism of transcription factors at the atomic level, the behavior of fibrillar aggregates with a focus on Huntington fibrils and their interactions with small molecules, and the biased agonism of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their preferential signalling towards either G-proteins or β-arrestin.</description>

      <description>Matthias is currently a Research Scientist at UCLA. He completed his PhD in Biophysics at the Humboldt Universität zu Berlin under the supervision of Drs. Franz Bartl and Klaus Peter Hofmann. He then completed postdoctoral training at UCLA, under the supervision of Dr. Wayne Hubbell. In Spring 2023, Matthias will join the Institute for Drug Discovery and Institute for Medical Physics and Biophysics at the University of Leipzig as a Research Group Leader.</description>
