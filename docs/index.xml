      <description>Matthias received his PhD in Biophysics from the Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin, where he worked under the guidance of Drs. Klaus Peter Hofmann and Franz Bartl on time-resolved investigation of photoreactions of visual rhodopsin. He then received postdoctoral training in the laboratory of Dr. Wayne Hubbell at UCLA, where he studied other G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the beta-adrenergic and angiotensin receptors, using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>Our researchProteins “at work” constantly change shape in order to interact with binding partners such as ligands or other proteins. Membrane proteins in particular exhibit a high degree of flexibility to control transmembrane signaling processes. In the Elgeti Lab, we utilize electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and other biophysical, biochemical, and computational methods to characterize and understand membrane proteins. Our research connects protein structure to function and contributes to the development of more efficacious therapeutics with fewer side effects.</description>
